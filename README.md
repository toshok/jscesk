a CESK machine for JS


[https://github.com/toshok/echojs](EJS) needs a static analysis
framework to enable things like:

* lightweight closure conversion
* type specialization
* inlining

AAM ("Abstracting Abstract Machines") provides a means of mechanically
translating an Abstract Machine implementing a language's concrete
semantics into a machine implementing the abstract semantics.

a CESK machine is a good first step toward this goal, so here begins
my experiment.
